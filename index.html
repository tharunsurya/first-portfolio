                  <h3 class="text">I am an <span>Junior Full Stack Devloper</span></h3>
                  <p>This is my first portfolio webpage.I have currenty completed basic frontend softwares and i thought it would be better if i create my own portfolio website.
                     The concept of this website is wholely inspired by several other portfolio projects and i have mixed my own design which was designed using figma.
                     This was coded in visual studio code and the image was taken in google hope there will not be copyright. I thought of adding my own image since it is in instagram
                     This portfolio website and the upcomming other portfolio website will be updaated as quickly possible...have an look and do enjoy yourself <span> hope u enjoy</span>
